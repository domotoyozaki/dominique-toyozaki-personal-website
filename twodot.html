                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Because of the pandemic, it is hard to film anything right now. However, I still wanted to create a short film that said something and sparked conversation. After the horrfic events the US saw the first few months of 2020, I decided to try and have a conversation abotu race and specifically what race meant to those who are mixed. I ended up interviewing two amazing people who shared their stories with me and decided to animate some of it to help emphasize the story.</p>
                <h2>The Concept</h2>
                <P>Being someone who is mixed race, I wanted to try and get other people's sotries on what it is also like. I happen to be Japanese and Native Hawaiian, but most people tend to think of mixed people as white plus something else. The first story is of a young Asian women who comes to understand her mother after being brought up in a naive, white neighborhood. She comes to understand, respect, and love her mother for her sacrifices which helps her accept the non-white side of herself. The second story is one of a young African-American woman who talk about how she though she was ugly when she was growing up becuase of the harmful comments she recieved from those around her. In the end, both conclude that race truly isn't everything about a person and that we should love and accept everyone no matter what they look like. </P>
